# Test Plan

This document describes the manual test plan for the QL extension for Visual Studio Code.

The plan will be executed manually to start with but the goal is to eventually automate parts of the process (based on
effort vs value basis).

## What this doesn't cover

We don't need to test features (and permutations of features) that are covered by automated tests.

## Before releasing the VS Code extension

- Run at least one local query and MRVA using the existing version of the extension (to generate "old" query history items).
- Go through the required test cases listed below.
- Check major PRs since the previous release for specific one-off things to test. Based on that, you might want to
choose to go through some of the Optional Test Cases.

## Required Test Cases

### Local databases

#### Test case 1: Download a database from GitHub

1. Click "Download Database from GitHub" and enter `angular-cn/ng-nice` and select the javascript language if prompted

#### Test case 2: Import a database from an archive

1. Obtain a javascript database for `babel/babel`
   - You can do `gh api "/repos/babel/babel/code-scanning/codeql/databases/javascript" -H "Accept: application/zip" > babel.zip` to fetch a database from GitHub.
2. Click "Choose Database from Archive" and select the file you just downloaded above.

### Local queries

#### Test case 1: Running a path problem query and viewing results

1. Open the [javascript UnsafeJQueryPlugin query](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/javascript/ql/src/Security/CWE-079/UnsafeJQueryPlugin.ql).
2. Select the `angular-cn/ng-nice` database (or download it if you don't have one already)
3. Run a local query.
4. Once the query completes:
   - Check that the result messages are rendered
   - Check that the paths can be opened and paths are rendered correctly
   - Check that alert locations can be clicked on

#### Test case 2: Running a problem query and viewing results

1. Open the [javascript ReDoS query](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/javascript/ql/src/Performance/ReDoS.ql).
2. Select the `babel/babel` database (or download it if you don't have one already)
3. Run a local query.
4. Once the query completes:
   - Check that the result messages are rendered
   - Check that alert locations can be clicked on

#### Test case 3: Running a non-problem query and viewing results

1. Open the [cpp FunLinesOfCode query](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/cpp/ql/src/Metrics/Functions/FunLinesOfCode.ql).
2. Select the `google/brotli` database (or download it if you don't have one already)
3. Run a local query.
4. Once the query completes:
   - Check that the results table is rendered
   - Check that result locations can be clicked on

#### Test case 3: Can use AST viewer

1. Click on any code location from a previous query to open a source file from a database
2. Open the AST viewing panel and click "View AST"
3. Once the AST is computed:
   - Check that it can be navigated

### MRVA

#### Test Case 1: Running a path problem query and viewing results

1. Open the [javascript UnsafeJQueryPlugin query](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/javascript/ql/src/Security/CWE-079/UnsafeJQueryPlugin.ql).
2. Run a MRVA against the following repo list:

   ```json
   {
      "name": "test-repo-list",
      "repositories": [
         "angular-cn/ng-nice",
         "apache/hadoop",
         "apache/hive"
      ]
   }
   ```

3. Check that a notification message pops up and the results view is opened.
4. Check the query history. It should:
   - Show that an item has been added to the query history
   - The item should be marked as "in progress".
5. Once the query starts:
   - Check the results view
   - Check the code paths view, including the code paths drop down menu.
   - Check that the repository filter box works
   - Click links to files/locations on GitHub
   - Check that the query history item is updated to show the number of results
6. Once the query completes:
   - Check that the query history item is updated to show the query status as "complete"

#### Test Case 2: Running a problem query and viewing results

1. Open the [javascript ReDoS query](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/javascript/ql/src/Performance/ReDoS.ql).
2. Run a MRVA against the "Top 10" repositories.
3. Check that a notification message pops up and the results view is opened.
4. Check the query history. It should:
   - Show that an item has been added to the query history
   - The item should be marked as "in progress".
5. Once the query completes:
   - Check that the results are rendered with an alert message and a highlighted code snippet:

   ![highlighted-code-snippet](images/highlighted-code-snippet.png)

#### Test Case 3: Running a non-problem query and viewing results

1. Open the [cpp FunLinesOfCode query](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/cpp/ql/src/Metrics/Functions/FunLinesOfCode.ql).
2. Run a MRVA against a single repository (e.g. `google/brotli`).
3. Check that a notification message pops up and the results view is opened.
4. Check the query history. It should:
   - Show that an item has been added to the query history
   - The item should be marked as "in progress".
5. Once the query completes:
   - Check that the results show up in a table:

   ![results-table](images/results-table.png)

#### Test Case 4: Interacting with query history

1. Click a history item (for MRVA):
   - Check that exporting results works
   - Check that sorting results works
   - Check that copying repo lists works
2. Click "Open Results Directory":
   - Check that the correct directory is opened and there are results in it
3. Click "View Logs":
   - Check that the correct workflow is opened

#### Test Case 5: Canceling a variant analysis run

Run one of the above MRVAs, but cancel it from within VS Code:

- Check that the query is canceled and the query history item is updated.
- Check that the workflow run is also canceled.
- Check that any available results are visible in VS Code.

### General

#### Test case 1: Change to a different colour theme

Open at least one of the above MRVAs and at least one local query, then try changing to a different colour theme and check that everything looks sensible.
Are there any components that are not showing up?

## Optional Test Cases

These are mostly aimed at MRVA, but some of them are also applicable to non-MRVA queries.

### Selecting repositories to run on

### Query History

This requires running a MRVA query and viewing the query history.

The first test case specifies actions that you can do when the query is first run and is in "pending" state. We start
with this since it has quite a limited number of actions you can do.

   1. By name
   2. By query date
   3. By result count
5. Cannot open query directory
6. Can open query that produced these results
   1. When the file still exists and has not moved
   2. When the file does not exist
7. Cannot view logs
8. Cannot copy repository list
9. Cannot export results

    2. Files on dist are deleted (can get to files using "open query directory")
5. Can sort query history items
    1. By name
    2. By query date
    3. By result count
6. Can open query directory
7. Can open query that produced these results
    1. When the file still exists and has not moved
    2. When the file does not exist
8. Can view logs
9. Can copy repository list
   1. Text is copied to clipboard
   2. Text is a valid repository list
10. Can export results
11. Can select to create gist
    1. A gist is created
    2. The first thing in the gist is a summary
    3. Contains a file for each repository with results
    4. A popup links you to the gist
12. Can select to save as markdown
    1. A directory is created on disk
    2. Contains a summary file

   1. Ready results are downloaded
2. Can cancel analysis
   1. Causes the actions run to be canceled

#### Test case 4: When variant analysis state is in final state ("succeeded"/"failed"/"canceled")

1. Stops monitoring variant analysis
   1. All results are downloaded if state is succeeded
   2. Otherwise, ready results are downloaded, if any are available
2. Cannot cancel analysis

### MRVA results view

1. Can open a results view
2. Results view opens automatically
   - When starting variant analysis run

1. Add a database at the top level
1. Add a database to a list
1. Add a the same database at a top-level and in a list
1. Delete a list
1. Delete a database from the top level
1. Delete a database from a list
1. Add an owner

Error cases that trigger an error notification:

1. Try to add a list with a name that already exists

1. Edit the db config file directly and save valid JSON but invalid config (e.g. add an unknown property)
1. Edit the db config file directly and save two lists with the same name

Cases where there the welcome view is shown:
