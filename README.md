* Shows the flow of data through the results of path queries, which is essential for triaging security results.
* Provides an easy way to run queries from the large, open source repository of [CodeQL security queries](https://github.com/github/codeql).
* Adds IntelliSense to support you writing and editing your own CodeQL query and library files.

## Project goals and scope
