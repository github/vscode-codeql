## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
1. Set up a local build
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Make your change
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]
1. Pat yourself on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

* Follow the [style guide][style].
* Write tests. Tests that don't require the VS Code API are located [here](extensions/ql-vscode/test). Integration tests that do require the VS Code API are located [here](extensions/ql-vscode/src/vscode-tests).
* Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
* Write a [good commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

## Setting up a local build

Make sure you have installed recent versions of vscode, node, and npm. Check the `engines` block in [`package.json`](https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/blob/main/extensions/ql-vscode/package.json) file for compatible versions. Earlier versions may work, but we no longer test against them.

To automatically switch to the correct version of node, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), which will pick-up the node version from `.nvmrc`.

### Installing all packages

From the command line, go to the directory `extensions/ql-vscode` and run

```shell
npm install
```

### Building the extension

From the command line, go to the directory `extensions/ql-vscode` and run

```shell
npm run build
npm run watch
```

Alternatively, you can build the extension within VS Code via `Terminal > Run Build Task...` (or `Ctrl+Shift+B` with the default key bindings). And you can run the watch command via `Terminal > Run Task` and then select `npm watch` from the menu.

Before running any of the launch commands, be sure to have run the `build` command to ensure that the JavaScript is compiled and the resources are copied to the proper location.

We recommend that you keep `npm run watch` running in the backgound and you only need to re-run `npm run build` in the following situations:

1. on first checkout
2. whenever any of the non-TypeScript resources have changed

### Installing the extension

You can install the `.vsix` file from within VS Code itself, from the Extensions container in the sidebar:

`More Actions...` (top right) `> Install from VSIX...`

Or, from the command line, use something like (depending on where you have VSCode installed):

```shell
$ code --install-extension dist/vscode-codeql-*.vsix # normal VSCode installation
# or maybe
$ vscode/scripts/code-cli.sh --install-extension dist/vscode-codeql-*.vsix # if you're using the open-source version from a checkout of https://github.com/microsoft/vscode
```

### Debugging

You can use VS Code to debug the extension without explicitly installing it. Just open this directory as a workspace in VS Code, and hit `F5` to start a debugging session.

### Running the unit tests and integration tests that do not require a CLI instance

Unit tests and many integration tests do not require a copy of the CodeQL CLI.

Outside of vscode, in the `extensions/ql-vscode` directory, run:

```shell
npm run test && npm run integration
```

Alternatively, you can run the tests inside of vscode. There are several vscode launch configurations defined that run the unit and integration tests. They can all be found in the debug view.

Only the _With CLI_ tests require a CLI instance to run. See below on how to do that.

Running from a terminal, you _must_ set the `TEST_CODEQL_PATH` variable to point to a checkout of the `github/codeql` repository. The appropriate CLI version will be downloaded as part of the test.

### Running the integration tests

The _Launch Integration Tests - With CLI_ tests require a CLI instance in order to run. There are several environment variables you can use to configure this.

From inside of VSCode, open the `launch.json` file and in the _Launch Integration Tests - With CLI_ uncomment and change the environment variables appropriate for your purpose.

## Releasing (write access required)

1. Double-check the `CHANGELOG.md` contains all desired change comments and has the version to be released with date at the top.
    * Go through all recent PRs and make sure they are properly accounted for.
    * Make sure all changelog entries have links back to their PR(s) if appropriate.
1. Double-check that the node version we're using matches the one used for VS Code. If it doesn't, you will then need to update the node version in the following files:
    * `.nvmrc` - this will enable `nvm` to automatically switch to the correct node version when you're in the project folder
    * `.github/workflows/main.yml` - all the "node-version: <version>" settings
    * `.github/workflows/release.yml` - the "node-version: <version>" setting
1. Double-check that the extension `package.json` and `package-lock.json` have the version you intend to release. If you are doing a patch release (as opposed to minor or major version) this should already be correct.
1. Create a PR for this release:
    * This PR will contain any missing bits from steps 1 and 2. Most of the time, this will just be updating `CHANGELOG.md` with today's date.
    * Create a new branch for the release named after the new version. For example: `v1.3.6`
    * Create a new commit with a message the same as the branch name.
    * Create a PR for this branch.
    * Wait for the PR to be merged into `main`
1. Switch to `main` and add a new tag on the `main` branch with your new version (named after the release), e.g.
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git tag v1.3.6
    ```

   If you've accidentally created a badly named tag, you can delete it via 
    ```bash
    git tag -d badly-named-tag
    ```
1. Push the new tag up:

   a. If you're using a fork of the repo:

    ```bash
    git push upstream refs/tags/v1.3.6
    ```
   
   b. If you're working straight in this repo:

    ```bash
    git push origin refs/tags/v1.3.6
    ``` 
   
   This will trigger [a release build](https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/releases) on Actions.

    * **IMPORTANT** Make sure you are on the `main` branch and your local checkout is fully updated when you add the tag.
    * If you accidentally add the tag to the wrong ref, you can just force push it to the right one later.
1. Monitor the status of the release build in the `Release` workflow in the Actions tab.
1. Download the VSIX from the draft GitHub release at the top of [the releases page](https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/releases) that is created when the release build finishes.
1. Unzip the `.vsix` and inspect its `package.json` to make sure the version is what you expect,
   or look at the source if there's any doubt the right code is being shipped.
1. Install the `.vsix` file into your vscode IDE and ensure the extension can load properly. Run a single command (like run query, or add database).
1. Go to the actions tab of the vscode-codeql repository and select the [Release workflow](https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease).
    - If there is an authentication failure when publishing, be sure to check that the authentication keys haven't expired. See below.
1. Approve the deployments of the correct Release workflow. This will automatically publish to Open VSX and VS Code Marketplace.
1. Go to the draft GitHub release in [the releases tab of the repository](https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/releases), click 'Edit', add some summary description, and publish it.
1. Confirm the new release is marked as the latest release at <https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/releases>.
1. If documentation changes need to be published, notify documentation team that release has been made.
1. Review and merge the version bump PR that is automatically created by Actions.

## Secrets and authentication for publishing

Repository administrators, will need to manage the authentication keys for publishing to the VS Code marketplace and Open VSX. Each requires an authentication token. The VS Code marketplace token expires yearly.

To regenerate the Open VSX token:

1. Log in to the [user settings page on Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/user-settings/namespaces).
1. Make sure you are a member of the GitHub namespace.
1. Go to the [Access Tokens](https://open-vsx.org/user-settings/tokens) page and generate a new token.
1. Update the secret in the `publish-open-vsx` environment in the project settings.

To regenerate the VSCode Marketplace token, please see our internal documentation. Note that Azure DevOps PATs expire every 90 days and must be regenerated.
