## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
1. Set up a local build
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Make your change
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]
1. Pat yourself on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

* Follow the [style guide][style].
* Write tests. Tests that don't require the VS Code API are located [here](extensions/ql-vscode/test). Integration tests that do require the VS Code API are located [here](extensions/ql-vscode/src/vscode-tests).
* Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

## Setting up a local build

Make sure you have a fairly recent version of vscode (>1.32) and are using nodejs
version >=v10.13.0. (Tested on v10.15.1 and v10.16.0).

### Installing all packages

From the command line, go to the directory `extensions/ql-vscode` and run

```shell
npm install
```

### Building the extension

From the command line, go to the directory `extensions/ql-vscode` and run

```shell
npm run build
npm run watch
```

Alternatively, you can build the extension within VS Code via `Terminal > Run Build Task...` (or `Ctrl+Shift+B` with the default key bindings). And you can run the watch command via `Terminal > Run Task` and then select `npm watch` from the menu.

Before running any of the launch commands, be sure to have run the `build` command to ensure that the JavaScript is compiled and the resources are copied to the proper location.

We recommend that you keep`npm run watch` running in the backgound and you only need to re-run  `npm run build` in the following situations:

1. on first checkout
2. whenever any of the non-TypeScript resources have changed
3. on any change to files included in the webview

### Installing the extension

You can install the `.vsix` file from within VS Code itself, from the Extensions container in the sidebar:

`More Actions...` (top right) `> Install from VSIX...`

Or, from the command line, use something like (depending on where you have VSCode installed):

```shell
$ code --install-extension dist/vscode-codeql-*.vsix # normal VSCode installation
# or maybe
$ vscode/scripts/code-cli.sh --install-extension dist/vscode-codeql-*.vsix # if you're using the open-source version from a checkout of https://github.com/microsoft/vscode
```

### Debugging

You can use VS Code to debug the extension without explicitly installing it. Just open this directory as a workspace in VS Code, and hit `F5` to start a debugging session.

### Running the unit/integration tests

Ensure the `CODEQL_PATH` environment variable is set to point to the `codeql` cli executable.

Outside of vscode, run:

```shell
npm run test && npm run integration
```

Alternatively, you can run the tests inside of vscode. There are several vscode launch configurations defined that run the unit and integration tests. They can all be found in the debug view.

## Releasing (write access required)

1. Double-check the `CHANGELOG.md` contains all desired change comments
   and has the version to be released with date at the top.
1. Double-check that the extension `package.json` has the version you intend to release.
   If you are doing a patch release (as opposed to minor or major version) this should already
   be correct.
1. Trigger a release build on Actions by adding a new tag on branch `main` of the format `vxx.xx.xx`
1. Monitor the status of the release build in the `Release` workflow in the Actions tab.
1. Download the VSIX from the draft GitHub release at the top of [the releases page](https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/releases) that is created when the release build finishes.
1. Optionally unzip the `.vsix` and inspect its `package.json` to make sure the version is what you expect,
   or look at the source if there's any doubt the right code is being shipped.
1. Log into the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/github).
1. Click the `...` menu in the CodeQL row and click **Update**.
1. Drag the `.vsix` file you downloaded from the GitHub release into the Marketplace and click **Upload**.
1. Go to the draft GitHub release, click 'Edit', add some summary description, and publish it.
1. Confirm the new release is marked as the latest release at <https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/releases>.
1. If documentation changes need to be published, notify documentation team that release has been made.
1. Review and merge the version bump PR that is automatically created by Actions.
