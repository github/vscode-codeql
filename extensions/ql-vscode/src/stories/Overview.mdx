Welcome to the Storybook for **CodeQL for Visual Studio Code**! This Storybook contains stories for components and pages in the extension.

### Switching themes

To switch between VSCode Dark+ and Light+ themes, use the button in the toolbar. This will not work on this document, so you'll only see
the changes applied to a different story.

### Writing stories

To create new stories, copy an existing story in the `src/stories` directory and modify it to use your component or page. Please note that
you are not able to access any VSCode specific APIs or receive messages from VSCode so an ideal component would use generic props. The
`vscode.postMessage` API is mocked but no message will be sent.

You are able to use all VSCode CSS variables; these are injected into the Storybook preview. However, only the Dark+ theme is supported. It
is currently not possible to preview your component in another theme.

For more information about how to write stories and how to add controls, please see the
[Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction).

### WebView UI Toolkit

As much as possible, we try to make use of the [WebView UI Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit): See the
[WebView UI Toolkit Storybook here](https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit/).

### Updating VSCode CSS variables

The VSCode CSS variables that are injected into the Storybook preview are defined in the `src/stories/vscode-theme-dark.css` file. They need to be
updated manually if new variables are added to VSCode. It can also be updated if you would like to manually preview a different theme. To update
these variables, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have selected the correct theme. If you want to use a variable which is currently not available and will be committed, please
   select the **Dark+** theme. You can use **Preferences: Color Theme** in the *Command Palette* to select the theme.

2. Open a WebView in VSCode (for example the results of a query)

3. Open the *Command Palette* (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P)

4. Select **Developer: Open WebView Developer Tools**

5. Now, you will need to find the `<html>` element in the lowest-level `<iframe>`. See the image below:

   <img src={iframeImage} alt="The iframe element showing in the VS Code webview developer tools element inspector" />

6. Once you have selected the `<html>` element as in the image above, click on **Show All Properties (... more)** (see image below). This will
   expand all CSS variables.

   <img src={stylesImage} alt="The styles tab of the VS Code webview developer tools element inspector" />

7. Copy all variables to the `src/stories/vscode-theme-dark.css` file.

8. Now, select the `<body>` element which is a direct child of the `<html>` element.

9. This time, you do not need to copy the variables. Instead, copy the styles on the `<body>` element to the `src/stories/vscode-theme-dark.css` file.
   See the image below for which styles need to be copied.

The same process can also be followed for updating the `src/stories/vscode-theme-light.css` file, but make sure to select the **Light+** theme.
